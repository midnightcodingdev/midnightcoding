##### \## ðŸ§© About



\*\*Midnight Coding\*\* is more than just code â€” itâ€™s a \*mindset\*.  

The goal is to create an environment of focus and flow, where learning and building happen quietly, one commit at a time.  

No talk. No rush. Just the rhythm of the keyboard.



Each project in this repository corresponds to a real coding session on \[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@midnightcoding-dev).
